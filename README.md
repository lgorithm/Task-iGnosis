# Customer Loyalty & Product Profitability Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes transaction data to identify the **most profitable products** and the **key characteristics of loyal customers**. The insights help in better **market segmentation** and **targeted marketing strategies**.

## Dataset
The analysis is based on two CSV files:
1. **purchase_behaviour.csv** – Contains customer information (LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER classification).
2. **transaction_data.csv** – Records individual transactions, including product details, sales, and customer IDs.

## Objectives
- Identify the **top 3 most profitable products** based on total sales.
- Analyze customer **loyalty patterns** by evaluating total spending and purchase frequency.
- Determine **key characteristics of loyal customers** (age group, spending habits, premium vs. budget buyers).
- Provide a **hypothesis on why these customers are loyal**.
- Support findings with **data visualizations**.

## Key Findings
### **Top 3 Most Profitable Products**
1. **Dorito Corn Chips Supreme 380g** – $40352.0
2. **Smiths Crinkle Chip Original Big Bag 380g** – $36367.6
3. **Smiths Crinkle Chips Salt & Vinegar 330g** – $34804.2

### **Most Loyal Customer Segments**
1. **Older Families (Budget Buyers)** – $168363.25 total spend
2. **YOUNG SINGLES/COUPLES (Mainstream buyers)** – $157621.60 total spend
3. **RETIREES (Mainstream buyers)** – $155677.05 total spend

### **Hypothesis: Why Are These Customers Loyal?**
Older families, especially those buying on a budget, are the most loyal and high-spending customers. They likely prioritize value-for-money products, buying larger pack sizes for household consumption. These families may also purchase snacks for kids or gatherings, leading to frequent and high-volume purchases.
